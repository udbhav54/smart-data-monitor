## 🎯 Why I Chose This Project

### Real-World Problem Solving

In today's digital world, data costs and network performance are critical concerns, especially for:

- Users with limited data plans who need to monitor usage
- Remote workers requiring reliable connectivity tracking
- Mobile users who need real-time network insights
- Developers testing application performance across different networks

### Technical Challenge

This project allowed me to:

- Master 5 different Web APIs in a single cohesive application
- Solve integration challenges between multiple browser technologies
- Build performance-optimized real-time data visualization
- Create responsive design that works across all devices
- Implement fallback strategies for various browser capabilities

### Innovation Opportunity

Rather than building separate demos for each API, I chose to create a unified application where all APIs work together, demonstrating how modern web technologies can solve complex problems when properly integrated.
